check_quake.sh

This is meant to be a Nagios plugin to monitor Quake servers. Currently only
Quake II server are supported, but it's easy to to any types of servers that
are supported by qstat. This plugin uses qstat to do all the queries.

Note that this plugin is in very early development and does NOT yet comply with
the Nagios Plugin Development Guidelines.
The plugin is in use by myself to monitor a friends Quake II server and is 
working nicely, but it is not production ready!
