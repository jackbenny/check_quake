check_quake.sh

This is a Nagios plugin to monitor Quake servers. Currently only Quake II 
servers are supported, but more games will be added in the future.
This plugin uses qstat to do all the queries.
The plugin complies with the Nagios Plugin Development Guidelines. It has
some basic sanity checks, uses the default exit codes, follows the standard 
arguments, has only one line of output etc.

The plugin is in use by myself to monitor a friends Quake II server and is 
working nicely.
