check_quake.sh

This is meant to be a Nagios plugin to monitor Quake servers. Currently only
Quake II server are supported, but it's easy to to any types of servers that
are supported by qstat. This plugin uses qstat to do all the queries.

Note that this plugin does NOT yet comply with the Nagios Plugin Development 
Guidelines (for example missing some sanity checks).
The plugin is in use by myself to monitor a friends Quake II server and is 
working nicely.

Options:
-h
   Print detailed help screen
-V
   Print version information
-H 
   Set the host/IP of the server to watch
-P
   Set the port number of the Quake server to watch
   Default is 27910
--warning
   Issue a warning state instead of a critical state 
   Default is critical
